## Description 

When users interact with the text editor online, the service worker registers and takes charge of network requests. It intelligently caches essential resources, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets, during installation to enable offline access.

As users work with the editor, the application dynamically caches the content and associated resources for later retrieval. This means that notes or code snippets accessed while online will remain available even without an active internet connection. The editor's intuitive design allows users to seamlessly switch between online and offline modes, maintaining a consistent and reliable experience.
